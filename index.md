The following charts show case counts by case reported date per 100k by PHU for Ontario.  
The grey dots are the actual case counts, the blue line is the trailing 7 day average.

Note:  There are reports coming out starting ~ Dec 20th that PCR testing is hard to book or completely unavailable 
in certain health units.    It is very likely that these case counts are being undercounted, which will
be visible in %positivity rising, which it is.
